# GJG data visualization mini project

As you can see the project is not fully functional, if I had time I would have added a lot of stuff, but currently I'm working a full time Job and I was visiting out of the country for 3 weeks

### Examples for Stuff I wanted to add

- Data comparison tool
- Adding multiple tables
- Adding multiple graphs
- Prediction model depending on past data that we have

## Tech stack

- Ant d
- Typescript
- Chart JS
- Emotion Styled component

Note: What you see in the project this just a glimpse of the things I can do, I would be okai with having a techincal interview incase there's any questions or any concerns about my technical level
